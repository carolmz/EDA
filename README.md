# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing datasets to better understand their structure, patterns, and relationships between variables. EDA involves several key steps, such as:

- Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset.
- Statistical Summaries: Calculating measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation to get an overview of the data.
- Data Visualization: Creating plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to visually inspect distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.
- Identifying Patterns and Trends: Exploring how variables relate to each other, which helps in making informed decisions about data preprocessing or feature engineering.
- Detecting Anomalies: Identifying outliers or unusual patterns that might require further investigation or adjustments.
  
EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process because it helps analysts and data scientists make decisions about the next steps for model building and feature selection.
